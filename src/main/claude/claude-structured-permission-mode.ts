 * latched into the session record: the setting is the one copy of this fact, so nothing can
 * disagree with it and a failed restore cannot silently downgrade a session to prompting.
 *
 * Yolo still stores itself as the agent's bypass flag inside the launch arguments, which is also
 * what a terminal launch acts on, so presence of that flag is the fact to read — resolved through
 * the same default fallback the terminal uses, which is why an untouched profile bypasses. The
 * rest of the arguments string is a terminal concern this path does not interpret.
