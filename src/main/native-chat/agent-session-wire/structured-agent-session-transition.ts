// One provider event's journal writes, admitted as a single sink operation.
//
// A producer that keeps state about what it wrote must change that state only for writes the sink
// took; when an event needs several rows, a refusal of the third after the first two were taken
// would leave the producer and the journal disagreeing. A transition is admitted whole or not at
// all. At execution its steps are issued in the same tick, so they sit together in the journal's
// write queue, and each step resolves against the fold with every earlier write landed — the
// steps before it included — so what a step writes is decided by the journal, not by memory.
// Admitted whole is not executed whole: a step that fails leaves the steps before it written, and
// fails the sink, so nothing more is admitted after it.
