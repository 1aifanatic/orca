// How the assembler's addresses become persisted journal identities.
//
// The assembler decides WHICH rows are the same row: it resolves every provider join to an
// address — the provider session's namespace, the key, the thread and turn the item belongs to,
// the item's class, and its place among its turn's messages — or mints a key when the provider
// names nothing. A scheme only spells an address as an `AgentJournalItemIdentity`. It must be pure,
// and it is the one place a provider's persisted identity shape lives, so moving a provider to a
// new identity arm is a change here.
