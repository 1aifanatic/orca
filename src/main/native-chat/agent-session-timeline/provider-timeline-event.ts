// The narrow grammar a provider adapter speaks to the timeline assembler.
//
// The adapter knows the provider's dialect; the assembler knows the timeline. An adapter parses
// provider traffic into these semantic events and never writes a journal row or mints a journal
// identity: every key here is the provider's own id (a turn, a tool call, a message, a thread),
// or a name the adapter keeps stable for something the provider does not name. The assembler
// resolves those joins to rows, scopes rows to turns, and owns the turn and item rules in
// `agent-session-journal-types.ts`; the journal decides, at each write, what a replay changes.
//
// Rules an adapter can rely on:
// - Only `turn.open` opens a turn. Items, text and requests never do: one that arrives with no
//   turn open and names none is written as a thread row. An adapter whose provider starts work on
//   its own (a background wake, auto-compaction) decides that a turn began and says `turn.open`
//   before that work's items.
// - `join.turn` attaches a row to the turn the provider says it belongs to, open or not.
// - A turn settles once, with only the provider's verdict; the journal refuses a second settlement
//   and a replayed open, even after a restart.
// - An event the sink refused changed nothing. Re-apply the same event to retry it (after
//   `backpressure`); `failed` and `closed` are final.
// - A provider item is (thread, id): the same id on another thread is another item. Text and
//   full snapshots of one id are one row, and its close settles it for both.
// - `dropped` is the verdict when the event was applied. The journal has the last word when the
//   event's writes run: a replay the journal already holds writes nothing even if it was taken.
// - After `session.ended` every event is dropped until `session.reset`. Reset whenever the
//   provider's ids may repeat (a new process): its ids then name new rows.
